Flask app that converts currency (CZ <-> USD) and temperature denominations.
This was setup originally to run on Red Hat's OpenShift PaaS platform - www.openshift.com

Though of arguable usefulness to anyone besides Americans in Czech Republic, feel free to use it here: http://converter-tocene.rhcloud.com/
