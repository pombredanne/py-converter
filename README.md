py-converter 0.2
============

Flask app that converts currency (CZ <-> USD), distance (K/m/ft/miles) and temperature denominations.
This was setup originally to run on Red Hat's OpenShift PaaS platform - www.openshift.com

Though of arguable usefulness to anyone besides (lazy) Americans in Czech Republic, feel free to use it here: http://converter-tocene.rhcloud.com/
