py-converter 0.2.4
============

Flask app that converts currency, distance (K/m/ft/miles), temperature, weight and liquid denominations that are useful
to me. This was setup originally to run on Red Hat's OpenShift PaaS platform - www.openshift.com 

Though of arguable usefulness to anyone besides (lazy) Americans living abroad, feel free to use it here: http://converter-tocene.rhcloud.com/
